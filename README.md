# Down The Path

> I was walking down the line,  
> Trying to find some peace of mind.  
> Then I saw you,  
> You were takin' it slow,  
> And walkin' it one step at a time.

A spartan implementation of H.O.T.T.

## Quick Examples

> "If you're lost now,  
> Maybe I could help you along and sing you a song,  
> And move you on."

## Type Theory

> She said  
> "I'm looking for a kind of shelter,  
> No place for me to call my own.  
> I've been walking all night long, but  
> I don't know where to call my home."

- [X] Start out with 0,1,∑,∏,U. (2, Nat are slightly more complicated.)
- [ ] Add `Id` and `ap`. Define `1-1-Corr`.
- [ ] Inductive types.
- [ ] Quotients without HIT?
- [ ] Higher inductive types.
- [ ] Inductive families?!

## Implementation

> "The only way to find that place is  
> Close to where my heart is.  
> I know I'm gonna get there,  
> But I've got to keep on walking down the line."

## Down the line

> I said  
> "You go on walking down the line,  
> Wasting all your precious time.  
> But you're never gonna find it,  
> Because there is no end to the line,  
> There's no destination for to find."
